# 
# This workflow will build and test a Java project with Maven.
#
# It is only triggered on master branch.
#
# It also:
#   - builds a distribution of anchor as a .tar.gz and .zip and uploads to GitHub Packages
#
# The Maven and SonarCloud working directories are cached for future reuse, as downloading all packages from scratch takes significant time.
